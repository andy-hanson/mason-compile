Compiler API for [Mason](http://mason-lang.org).

If you want to write a project in Mason, see [here](http://mason-lang.org/setup#build). The compiler is a library for use by those tools; it has no user interface.

In case you're wondering how the compiler works, the [generated documentation](http://mason-lang.org/mason-compile) can help alongide reading the code.
